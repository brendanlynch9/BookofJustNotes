      <div class="text">Perhaps one of the most important things to know in this entire book. 
              The walipini allows you to grow food 365 days a year. 24 hours a day. 
              7 days a week. Anywhere in the world. Essentially it is a pit greenhouse. 
              It does not matter what the surface temperature is on Earth. Because a few 
              feet down the temperature is maintained at a constant degree. It does not 
              matter if the temperature is 0 degrees in the dead of winter or 100 
              degrees in the heat of the summer... a few feet down and it is a constant
              50-60 degrees.With a little sunlight the wallipini can be warmed and 
              additional 10-30 degrees. Making it ideal to grow food. Combined with 
              vertical aquaponics (wherein you can grow 1,000,000 lbs. of food & 10,000 
              fish on 3 acres) this is essentially a grocery store for an entire village
              all year long potentially. If you have one walipini for food and another for
              plant based medicine (pharamcognosy) and a third for hemp (a non 
              psychoactive cousin of marijuana that was used for many commercial uses 
              and today over 5,000 industrial uses)... you have the ability to maintain an 
              entire village indefinetely. Further with C02 leeching the quality of food
              out... it will become increasingly important to have all your food growing 
              in greenhouses to maintain sufficient vitamin levels for the human body as
              climate shifts. Otherwise what you do grow will be about as good for your 
              body as eating cardboard essentially, in time. I cannot emphasize this
              enough.... LEARN THIS. <br>

      <div class="text">Now to put this delicately, the human body is one big tube for 
            turning all that delicious food into ...compost. Yes compost.
            You need to use every advantage you have when there is no power. 
            Compost helps plants grow. It occurs from the natural decomposition 
            of organic living matter. Of which human waste can be mixed at a 
            1:3 ratio with natural compost after the human waste has been turned 
            into compost itself.The feces is composted. The urine has another usage. 
            We will discuss that usage later in the book. For now understand that toilet 
            paper is a luxury. That however many other countries use a pidet to wash 
            their posterior with. Essentially in a grid down situation inside the 
            bathroom you can place a sprayer. Like what you woulld buy to spray 
            the sidewalk with or to water plants with. There are many ways to dry 
            your posterior with naturally occuring local plants. This composting 
            toilet is the only way to keep disease from killing your village without 
            flowing water and septic tank cleaners etc. The water pipelines will not

      <div class="text">Now we have seen that electricity is required for much. In fact 
            People do not realize just how much. It actually occurs naturally 
            even! Takeing a magensium rod and other assorted items can give you 
            a small "battery" for a time. The only purpose of this battery and why 
            it is included in the book is to generate hyrogen. Hydrogen is a gas 
            that you can aquire by splitting water with 1.5 volts of electricity. 
            The uses of hydrogen are many. However for our purposes, is a "PEM" was 
            purchased prior to the grid going down, (or alternatively aquired from 
            a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle) then with hydrogen being sent through one 
            end and oxygen being sent through the other end you would have a means
            to create PURE H20. And ...electricity. Enough to power a fan on your
            composting toilet so that it did not stink to high heaven every time 
            you walked into it.  <br>

      <div class="text">Now while a PEM can move a small fan,  there is no way you will 
            generate enough electricity with a trickle of hydrogen, to move a 
            pump required to cool down a refrigerator or AC unit. So how will you 
            keep all your food stored without turning it into pemmican? simple. 
            For centuries in nigeria and the west coast of africa people have 
            used a zeer pot to maintain a cooling eefect. Two clay pots and sand.
            Add some cool water and place into a windy place (such like the doorways 
            of your walipini.... conveninet huh? See how the knowledge builds on 
            itself?). This will give you a refrigerator without electricity permanently 
            if done correctly. This is the secondary reason you want to control humidity
            inside a walipini. <br>

            walipini at 60's. Hence you want no more than 20% humidity at any given

            the deer. Its meat is delicious and tender and its skin is

      <div class="text">How do you make a cup? A frying pan? The answer is that you 
             need to know how to melt metal and pour it into a sand mould. 
            In order to do that you need to know alot of things. Metal casting 
            is quite literally a lost art but is a requirement of the modern 
            civillization that surrounds most people in a 1st world country. 
            Without sand casting you cannot have modern civillization precisely 
            because in order to make a power plant you must know how to make a  
            metal drum. Or a condensation metal tube. or... ad nauseum. Below are  
            the lost formularies of the constituent base materials needed to use this 
            skill. It is an art and a skill that few mastered. Today most castings 
            are done by highly complex machinery. However it is possibleto do it 
            by hand. Greensand can be used many times over for low heat castings 
            such like aluminum or brass. They require a lower heat to cast with. 
            Iron requires a petro bonded sand because it requires such a high heat 
            to work with. Core making is creating a hard sand that makes a void such 
            like in a casting of a cup. The negative space is made up by a "core". 
            Clay crucibles are used once. Graphite crucibles c an be used a few times 
            to cast with. You need a furnace mortar mix to make the furnance immune 
            to all the flames so that the heat is swirling around the crucible heating 
            it and melting the metal within the crucible and not the furnace itself. <br>

            At the other end of the pipe we have a hair dryer to blow the oil forward 
            towards the furnace wherein it is lit and thus the flame circles around

      <div class="text">Now that we understand the flow of the oil into the furnace and 
            we also understand how to build a furnace and how to make the required 
            commodities to use in a casting... how exactly do we cast a metal object? 
            Here are the required steps in order. A casting is essentially a copy of 
            any object turned into metal. Withut objects you can alwasy carve the item 
            out of wood first and cut the item in half. This is called a mould. The cope 
            and drag are simply boards joined together to form a square large enough 
            to hold the mould in. one square for each half of your mould. <br>

      <div class="text">One of the first things after you have settled in to your home to cast 
            Is a way to determine earthquakes. Why? Because should the precipitating 
            factor of the electric grid being taken away be due to Nuclear war....the 
            tectonic after effects will be spectacular. You already have a means to 
            determine weather and forecast however you still need to be able to tell 
            when the shaking will stop. Even if non nuclear means are used to dismantle 
            the grid you will still need an earthquake detector to determine if there are 
            secondary explosions occuring from such like powerplants or nuclear facilities 
            nearby. The chinese made a very simple and genius way of determining that. <br>

            to manage with some metal casting, the next important thing to do is to 
            ramp up our food production. You can grow 1,000,000 lbs. of food and 
            10,000 fish on 3 acres. Yes THREE ACRES. with a style of food crop 
            production known as aquaponics. In simplistic terms the fish (normally 
            tilapia) feed the plants and the plants feed the fish in an infinite 
            loop. Growing vertically the fish poop feeds the filter plants (duckweed
            usually) at the top tray. Then the water descends and feeds the second
            tray gathering nutrients from the plant roots. Eventually dropping back
            down into the aquarium wherein a simple pump lifts the water back to the
            top. Ad infinitum. You can place two aquaponics gardens in each walipini
            with the given dimensions of the walipini alresdy measured out for you.
            Essentially turning each wallipini into three wallipinis. You want a
            curved fish tank bottom to accomodate the run off. Lifting the water
            can be done with electricity or it can be done with a water ram effect
            that I will show you later. Take heed. I am not a liscened electrician.

            After bandaging and cleaning there will be pain to deal with. AFTER the 
            bleeding has stopped and the wound is healing you can consider aspirin. 
            Aspirin thins the blood and can cause more extensive bleeding. So as a

            internally or externally and also only when no other contraindications 
            are present such like age or polypharmacy (using other drugs that would

            and prolonged usage can cause stomach bleeding. Always take with food.
            Be very careful of the dosage because you can toxify a liver if you take
            too much aspirin in a day(beyond 2000mg if memory serves). Collect the
